                <h1>About me</h1>
            <span>Hello, I’m Rachel and I really love food! I started cooking at age 11 when I put a half cup of baking soda into a batch of cookies instead of a half teaspoon. Because…what’s the worst that could happen, right? The cookies were a spectacular fail and it got me interested in cooking. I’ve amassed several years of both formal and informal culinary training over the years. Thanks to the wonderful world of the internet I’ve been able to pursue my dream of cooking professionally, all while cooking barefoot from the comfort of my own home kitchen. My recipes are used in restaurants and bakeries around the world, I’m a published cookbook author, and I’m able to work with some of the largest food and kitchenware brands in the world. Here on The Stay At Home Chef is where I share my recipes and recipe video tutorials with a worldwide audience–all for free! You don’t have to be a professional chef to make restaurant-quality meals at home. It’s my goal to help you feed your family delicious foods and give you good healyh!
