                5.0⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
                <p>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed, mostly natural ingredients with at least one raw ingredient.
                    They are often dressed, and typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be
                    served warm. Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or
                    spinach; they are common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads

                5.0⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
                <p>Moist roasted chicken gets the royal treatment with caramelized onions, balsamic vinegar and creamy
                    risotto. You may choose to roast your own chicken or purchase a rotisserie chicken from a grocery
                    store. A little grated cheese such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano before serving is also a nice
                    touch.</p>
