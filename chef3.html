            <span>I’m Chef Taffy
                I’m a professional chef, cooking instructor, recipe developer, food writer and former restaurant owner,
                with over 20 years experience in the food industry.

                Born into a family of artists and cooks in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I learned early on that food was a
                powerful medium for creation and change.

                I now cook and develop recipes in New York’s Hudson Valley, where I live with my husband Pizza Man and
                our rescue cat Kit-Kat
